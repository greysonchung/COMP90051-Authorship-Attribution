Authorship attribution is a task to identify the author of a given document. This project aims to come up with test predictions for an authorship attribution problem given a training set and test inputs. The test data contains a list of 2,000 papers, and the task is to predict for each of the test papers, whether the given target is an author/co-author of the paper.
